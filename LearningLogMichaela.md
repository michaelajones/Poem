<h3>Things I leant...</h3>
<p>Throughout my research on storage devices and number systems I learnt several things including that storage devices are the homeof all binary data inside a computer.
I also learnt how to apply HTML and CSS during the constructing of our website. This project gave us the opportunity to apply some of the knowledge we learnt 
in Khan Academy about HTML and CSS. I was interesting and useful  to actually use what we had already learnt, because we actually got to create it, rather then follow a 
tutorial on Khan Academy.</p>

<h3>Things I stil want to learn...</h3>
<p>In the future I'd like to continue to learn more about diffrent number systems because we only really looked at binary during our research.
I'd also like to continue to grow my knowledge with CSS so I can make for example our website more intricate.</p>
